## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol for exposing tools and agents as interoperable services. MCP enables tools like this PDF Summary Agent to be orchestrated, composed, or called programmatically by other systems, agents, or workflows. This project provides both a tool interface and a server endpoint for MCP integration.
